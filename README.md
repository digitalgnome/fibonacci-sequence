# [Fibonacci Sequence Calculator](https://digitalgnome.github.io/fibonacci-sequence/)



Repo created for Ashland JavaScript Meetup Code Challenge # 3.  Requirement for the challenge were to create a Fibonacci sequence given a user integer input number, and to display the next ten numbers in the sequence.  A modal given more detail was added incase a user wanted to understand more about how the sequence numbers are generated.

A simple regular expression is used to detect that the user input is an integer.  Based on the sequence starting number, JavaScript is used to calculate and create a starting array based on the previous sequence number from the starting number(n).  The rest of the ten number sequence is created, and the the n-1 value is removed from the final array. 

The output is displayed to a table in an animated format using the jQuery animate method.

An excellent explanation for the Fibonacci sequence can be found at:
